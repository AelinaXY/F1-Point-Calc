This app is a script that calculates the optimal f1 fantasy team maximising a single variable against cost.

Future possible changes:
Implement the parsing of different grand prix so it is no longer a list of points but a map. Add to this a measure of how similar each track is and place additional weighting on that information to inform how data is done. 


Creating a considating / error metric in order to evaulute algorithim success.
Add last years data to the application/spreadsheet
Use to calculate and fine tune algorithm
Create track locality with randomness of weighting
Create ability to run championships against each other using previous years data
Multi dimensional linear regression
